Tech Stack üõ†Ô∏è
Frontend: HTML5, Tailwind CSS, Vanilla JavaScript

AI & Backend: Google Gemini API

File Processing: PDF.js, Mammoth.js (Client-side)

PDF Generation: jsPDF (Client-side)

Deployment: Netlify

How It Works
Upload: A user uploads a resume (PDF/DOCX) and can optionally paste a job description.

Text Extraction: The application uses client-side libraries (PDF.js/Mammoth.js) to extract the raw text from the file, ensuring user privacy as the file never leaves the browser.

API Call: The extracted text is sent to the Google Gemini API with a detailed prompt instructing it to parse the data, perform an analysis, and return a structured JSON object.

Display Results: The frontend receives the JSON data and dynamically renders it in a clean, tabbed interface for easy navigation.

Export: The jsPDF library is used to generate a formatted PDF report from the structured data.
