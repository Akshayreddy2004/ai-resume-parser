Key Features ‚ú®
Multi-Format Upload: Accepts resumes in both PDF and DOCX formats.

AI-Powered Parsing: Instantly extracts key information such as contact details, work experience, education, and skills into a structured format.

Job Match Analysis: Provides a percentage-based match score and a detailed justification by comparing the resume against a pasted job description.

Interview Question Generator: Automatically creates relevant technical and behavioral interview questions (with sample answers) tailored to the candidate's profile.

Professional PDF Export: Downloads a clean, formatted PDF report of the entire analysis with a single click.

Modern & Responsive UI: A sleek, dark-themed interface that is fully responsive and works beautifully on any device.

Tech Stack üõ†Ô∏è
Frontend: HTML5, Tailwind CSS, Vanilla JavaScript

AI & Backend: Google Gemini API

File Processing: PDF.js, Mammoth.js (Client-side)

PDF Generation: jsPDF (Client-side)

Deployment: GitHub Pages & Netlify

How It Works
Upload: A user uploads a resume (PDF/DOCX) and can optionally paste a job description.

Text Extraction: The application uses client-side libraries (PDF.js/Mammoth.js) to extract the raw text from the file, ensuring user privacy as the file never leaves the browser.

API Call: The extracted text is sent to the Google Gemini API with a detailed prompt instructing it to parse the data, perform an analysis, and return a structured JSON object.

Display Results: The frontend receives the JSON data and dynamically renders it in a clean, tabbed interface for easy navigation.

Export: The jsPDF library is used to generate a formatted PDF report from the structured data.

Setup & Installation
This project is fully client-side and can be run by simply opening the index.html file in a browser. However, to use the AI features, you must have a valid Google Gemini API key.

Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/Akshayreddy2004/ai-resume-parser.git

Navigate to the project directory:

cd ai-resume-parser

Open index.html in your code editor.

Find the apiKey variable in the <script> section and paste in your own Google Gemini API key.

Open the index.html file in your browser (preferably using a live server extension).
